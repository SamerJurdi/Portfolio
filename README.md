## Modules

### User Module

I use Formik forms with Yup validation in Login and Signup.
As for keeping passwords secure, I used argon hashing algorithm.
Once you login I use iron-session to keep track of your user between pages.

### E-commerce Module

Once logged in, you will be allowed to purchase products, gain points in your wallet and review transaction history.
-Log in
-Find a package you like
-Buy Now
-Pay (Demo: Test success and failure cases)
-Review order history

### Auction Module

Logged in users can join several auctions at once and bid instantly.
I use a wallet system to secure the payment and prevent bidders exploiting the instant bid feature.
Users may withdraw from an auction if they are no longer the highest bidders.
